Assignment Node IV.0

You will notice that todays project, myg63 is incomplete in that it is unfinished 
with respect to handling post data from the /contacts HTML5 form. 
Finish it in the the same way as assignment III.2. 
Please refer to the solutions shown at the start of todays lesson.

Assignment Node IV.0

Play with the software from todays lesson, and expand it so that in stead of 
writing a receipt for the entered contact you write it into a json file that 
collects all the contact info in an array. The contacts must be dated in the file. 
Prove the concept by printing the file. Hint: The solution to the first lesson's assignment 2 prints a json file.

Assignment Node IV.1

Create a view containing a list of contacts from the previous assignments in an HTML5 setting. 
Hint: The solution to the previous lesson's display of the receipt might be a way of doing just that.
